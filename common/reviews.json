She is an excellent communicator, always available, and breaks down the market trends in a way that anyone can relate to. She has extensive knowledge and experience in the presale market, and as a first time home buyer,  I felt comfortable working with her and asking her questions.  She's definitely honest, professional and transparent with the real estate process.  Thanks for your everything Kitty!",
