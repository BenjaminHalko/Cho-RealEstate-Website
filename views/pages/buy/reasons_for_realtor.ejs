                <h4>1. Agents are bound by eithcs and the law.</h4>
                <p>You can expect competent service from real estate agents because they are required to be honest and thorough while representing you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h4>2. Agents know how to negotiate with a seller and other Realtors®.</h4>
                <p>Home negotiations can be complicated and involve a wide range of factors. Your agent will look out for your interests and look out for items you may have missed. From the purchase agreement to closing, their job is to make sure you get the best deal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h4>3. Agents know what to look for in a home.</h4>
                <p>A knowledgeable agent can help you determine whether a home is a smart investment, compared to comparable homes in the neighbourhood. A Realtor® is also a great resource for information on the area and surrounding facilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h4>4. Agents have access to the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and will keep tabs on the market for you.</h4>
                <p>The MLS gives agents the latest information on every home listed by a real estate agent in your market. Using this system, a Realtor can tell you how long a property has been on the market and special features it may have to offer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h4>5. Agents can direct you to all the people and services you will need to complete the deal.</h4>
                <p>An agent can recommend house inspectors, title companies, and tax and legal professionals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h4>+ 1 FOR PRESALE.  Services are paid by the seller, aka the Developer.</h4>
                <p>In the case of a Presale, the Buyer's agent is paid by the Developer and the Buyer doesn't pay the realtor's fee.  Always go with your realtor to the Presentation Centre as the sales team at the Presale works for the Developer.</p>
