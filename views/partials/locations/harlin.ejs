<h3>About</h3>
<p>Introducing Harlin by Wesgroup, a gateway tower to the Waterfront pathways of the River District, where luxury living meets unrivaled convenience. The highrise offers a mix of studio to 3-bedroom condominiums, eight garden suites, six penthouses, and five townhomes.</p>
<p>Located in southeast Vancouver on the north bank of the Fraser River, Harlin is part of a 130-acre, master-planned development that will be home to 18,000 residents upon completion. As a sustainable, complete community, it will also include 25 acres of parkland, a variety of community amenities, 500,000 sq ft of Town Centre commercial space, and even its own apiary. Current businesses already include Save-On-Foods, Shoppers Drug Mart, Bosley's Pet Store, Starbucks, Everything Wine, and Orange Theory Fitness.</p>
<p>Four childcare facilities, an elementary school, a secondary school, and a 30,000-sq-ft Waterfront Precinct community centre are included in the master plan. Landscaped pedestrian linkages between buildings and the 1.5-kilometre Fraser River Greenway, encourage walking. Cycle routes with bikeshare stations will connect to Burnaby in the east and the West Fraser Lands.</p>
